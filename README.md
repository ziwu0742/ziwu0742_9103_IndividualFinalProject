# ziwu0742_9103_IndividualFinalProject

## Individual Work Overview
For this individual work, I chose to apply the coding skills I acquired in this course to make certain elements of the artwork interactive. I chose timed events to drive my individual code. 

### Top Layer

Using `setInterval()` to achieve random color changes in the top layer, and applying `lerp()` to create vertical movement for the triangle and one of the quadrilaterals. The trigger is set to automated, and the shape's size updates every 60 frames.

### Middle Layer

I used `setTimeout()` to make the rectangle in the middle layer gradually disappear 2.5 seconds after the page opens, emphasizing the concept of negative space in the original artwork. 

### Base Layer 
For the lines at the base, I added a `movementOffset` parameter along with sin() and cos() oscillation effects to keep the visuals dynamic.


Instructions on how to interact with the work; e.g. move the mouse slowly over the screen, click the play button and wait for the music to start, load the page and the animation will happen over x number of seconds or whatever is needed to make your code come alive.
Details of your individual approach to animating the group code. 

## Instruction 
Run the code, the artwork changes gradually over time.
