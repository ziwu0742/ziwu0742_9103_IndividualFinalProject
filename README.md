## Individual Work Overview
For this individual work, I chose to apply the coding skills I acquired in this course to make certain elements of the artwork interactive, allowing them to _respond_ to different types of timing events
### Header 3

Instructions on how to interact with the work; e.g. move the mouse slowly over the screen, click the play button and wait for the music to start, load the page and the animation will happen over x number of seconds or whatever is needed to make your code come alive.
Details of your individual approach to animating the group code.
Which did you choose to drive your individual code: audio, interaction, Perlin noise or time.
Which properties of the image will be animated and how; highlighting how it is unique from other group members (i.e. one changes colours, the other component sizes, another reveals only some components at a time, etc.). You will need to work with your group members to make sure your work is sufficiently different from each other.
References to inspiration for animating your individual code; these can be images (still or gifs). How did they influence your submission?
A short technical explanation of how your individual code works to animate the image and any appropriate references.
If you made a lot of changes to the group code, explain it here.
If you use tools and technique from outside the course, explain why you used them and how they work.
If you copy a technique from the Internet, explain how it works, why you used it, and where it came from.
